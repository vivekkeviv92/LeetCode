MEDIUM
402. Remove K Digits

Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:

The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:

Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

    Iterating the sequence of digits from left to right, the main loop can be broken down as follows:

    1). for each digit, if the digit is less than the top of the stack, i.e. the left neighbor of the digit, then we pop the stack, i.e. removing the left neighbor. At the end, we push the digit to the stack.

    2). we repeat the above step (1) until any of the conditions does not hold any more, e.g. the stack is empty (no more digits left). or in another case, we have already removed k digits, therefore mission accomplished.
